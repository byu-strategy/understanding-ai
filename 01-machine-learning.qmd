According to John D. Kelleher "the field of artificial intelligence was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in the summer of 1956."

## Machine Learning

Supervised Learning: "Here’s the question and the right answer."\
Unsupervised Learning: "Here is some data, can you find patterns and/or organize it in a meaningful way?"\
Reinforcement Learning: "You’re an agent playing a, figure out the best strategy through trial and error, using only points (rewards) as feedback."

"During training, a machine learning algorithm processes a dataset and chooses the function that best matches the patterns in the data."

supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is the most widely used type of machine learning and significantly overlaps with the methodologies of other quantitative fields, such as econometrics.

Supervised learning gets its name from the fact that the input data set has examples of both inputs and outputs.

The outputs are called labels, hence you will sometime hear the term "labeled dataset."

-   **logistic (sigmoid) function**:

-   **Softmax**:

### Regression

### Classification

## Loss Functions

A loss function is a mathematical function that measures the difference between a model's predicted output and the true target value from a training dataset. It produces a scalar value representing the error for a single data point or the average error over a batch.

-   **Cross entropy loss**: “cross entropy” and “negative average log probability” related and often used interchangeably in practice.”

-   **Perplexity**: “Perplexity is a measure often used alongside cross entropy loss to evaluate the performance of models in tasks like language modeling. ”

## Gradient Descent

## Linear Regression

```{python}
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Input text
text = "I love to eat pizza"
tokens = text.split()

# Step 2: Create vocabulary and mappings
vocab = {word: i for i, word in enumerate(set(tokens))}
reverse_vocab = {i: word for word, i in vocab.items()}

# Step 3: Build a DataFrame
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "Current Word": tokens[:-1],
    "Next Word": tokens[1:]
})
data["Current Index"] = data["Current Word"].map(vocab)
data["Next Index"] = data["Next Word"].map(vocab)

# Step 4: Train the model
X = data["Current Index"].values.reshape(-1, 1)
y = data["Next Index"].values
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Step 5: Make prediction
input_word = "eat"
input_index = vocab[input_word]
predicted_index = round(model.predict([[input_index]])[0])
predicted_word = reverse_vocab.get(predicted_index, "UNKNOWN")

# Step 6: Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
plt.scatter(X, y, color='blue', label="Training data")
plt.plot(X, model.predict(X), color='red', linestyle='--', label="Regression line")
plt.scatter([input_index], [predicted_index], color='green', s=100, label=f"Prediction for '{input_word}'")
plt.title("Linear Regression on Word Indices")
plt.xlabel("Current Word Index")
plt.ylabel("Next Word Index")
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Display table and prediction
print("Token Table:\n")
print(data)
print("\nPrediction:")
print(f"Input word: '{input_word}' (index {input_index})")
print(f"Predicted next word index: {predicted_index}")
print(f"Predicted next word: '{predicted_word}'")
