That assistance should provide a period of intensive learning in a stimulating setting where a commitment to excellence is expected and the full realization of human potential is pursued.\nBYU seeks to develop students of faith, intellect, and character who have the skills and the desire to continue learning and to serve others throughout their lives.\nA BYU education should be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service.\nBuilding on the foundational Mission and Aims, the Marriott School of Business aspires to transform the world through Christlike leadership by developing leaders of faith, intellect, and character guided by the following 4 values:\n\nFaith in Christ - We value deep and abiding faith in Jesus Christ. Our faith gives us the capacity to envision a better future, the confidence to make that future happen, and the courage to act in the face of challenges.\nIntegrity in Action - We value integrity and hold ourselves to the highest moral and ethical standards. Acting with integrity builds trust, strengthens character, and focuses our ambitions on things of eternal consequence.\nRespect for All - We value respect for all individuals as children of God and recognize the inherent worth, divine potential, and agency of each person. A climate of respect and belonging enhances our learning, facilitates collaboration, and encourages personal growth.\nExcellence - We value excellence in learning, teaching, research, management, and leadership. An expectation of excellence magnifies our influence and motivates us to continually improve.\n\nWe evaluate our decisions and actions by the impact they will have on the academic experience, professional preparation, character development, emotional well-being, and spiritual growth of our students.\n\n1.7.1.1 Prayer in class\nWe will begin each class with prayer. Each class member is invited to be voice for the prayer at least once throughout the semester. The TAs will reach out prior to class to invite you to pray on a particular day. If you’d rather not be voice for a prayer please let me know on the first day of class so I can instruct the TAs accordingly.\n\n\n1.7.1.2 Laptop Policy\nYou may use laptops in class for note taking or other class related purposes. Laptops should not be used for activities that would be a distraction to nearby students when your screen is in their line of sight (e.g. sports, instagram, etc.)\n\n\n1.7.1.3 Cold Calling\nI teach in a fairly conversational style, which includes cold calling students to ask for your input or to pose questions. If you’d rather I not cold call on you please let me know on the first day of class so that I can avoid doing so. I have deep respect for individual learning styles and will make accommodations when needed.",

Once trained, the model can apply that learned relationship to make predictions on new, unseen data.\nTo build a machine learning model, we need four key ingredients:\nSo what exactly is being learned? The computer is learning the weights (parameters) of the chosen model. This is best understood through an example.

    "section": "3.2 Simple Linear Regression",
    "text": "3.2 Simple Linear Regression\n\n3.2.1 1st Ingredient: Mathematical model\nA simple linear regression model takes a single input variable \\(x\\) and predicts the value of a corresponding output variable \\(y\\). For example, the input variable might represent a house’s square footage, and the output variable could represent the value of the home.\nWe can write down the relationship between square footage and value in the form of a mathematical equation (also called a mathematical function or a model):\n\\[\ny = w_0 + w_1 x\n\\]\nWhere \\(y\\) represents the home value and \\(x\\) represents the square footage.\nIn machine learning jargon \\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\) are called the parameters or weights of the model (hence the use of \\(w\\) in the notation) and describe the nature of the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). \\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\) are the numbers that the computer will learn (i.e. derive) based on what is observed in real life which will be encoded into training data discussed in the next section.\nIn other fields such as econometrics these might be introduced using the greek alphabet notation of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\).\nYou might recognize this equation as the equation for a line in slope-intercept from which is often presented as:\n\\[\ny = mx + b\n\\]\nwhere \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are numbers in the coordinate plane with \\(m\\) representing the slope of the line and \\(b\\) representing the y-intercept (the point where the line crosses the y-axis) as shown in the image below:\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple linear regression and the equation of a line are in fact the same mathematical equation. In the context of linear regression, we simply use different notation: \\(w_1 = m\\) (the slope), and \\(w_0 = b\\) (the y-intercept which in machine learning is referred to as the bias term).\nIt’s common for different fields of study to use different notation and words for the same mathematical concepts. Unfortunately this can be one of the biggest sources of confusion for students so we will make an effort to call out these differences throughout the course.\nNow that we’ve shown that simple linear regression is actually just the equation of a line where \\(w_0\\) is the y-intercept and \\(w_1\\) is the slope we can have a visual picture in mind for how an input variable \\(x\\) and the output variable \\(y\\) are related.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple Linear Regression Line\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntuition check\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about our home value example, where we’re predicting a house’s price based on its square footage.\n\nWhat does your intuition tell you about the values \\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\) are likely to take on once they are estimated?\nDo you expect them to be positive or negative numbers?\nAssume \\(x\\) was \\(0\\), what would the equation be telling you?\n\n\n\n\nAs soon as we come up with values for \\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\) have a way predicting values of \\(y\\) when plugging in any value of \\(x\\) to the fitted equation.\nThe goal of machine learning is to learn the best possible values \\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\) allowing us to make good predictions of a homes value based on it’s square footage. We will soon explore how the computer learns these weight values but to build our intuiton on what the model does we can start by simply guessing values for the weights. For example, let’s assume:\n\\[\nw_0 = 50,\\!000 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad w_1 = 200\n\\]\nThen our function becomes:\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = 50,\\!000 + 200x\n\\]\nWe use the notation \\(\\hat{y}\\) (read as “y-hat”) here to emphasize that this is a now predicted value based on the model, not an observed or actual value.\nThis act of using the trained model to compute a prediction based on an input \\(x\\) is also called inference since we are inferring an estimated output \\(\\hat{y}\\).\nUsing this model we can predict that a home with 3,000 square feet will have a value of:\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = 50,\\!000 + 200 \\cdot 3,\\!000 = \\$650,\\!000\n\\]\nNow, consider what the model predicts for a home with 0 square feet:\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = 50,\\!000 + 200 \\cdot 0 = \\$50,\\!000\n\\]\nThis implies that the base value of the property—the land alone, with no house—might be interpreted as $50,000. This is exactly why both \\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\) are necessary. If we had included only \\(w_1 x\\) and omitted \\(w_0\\), the model would always predict 0 for an input of \\(x = 0\\), which might not reflect the reality (e.g., land still has value).\nIn machine learning, the term bias is used to refer to this \\(w_0\\) value. The name comes from the fact that it shifts (or “biases”) the entire output of the model up or down, independent of the input. Geometrically, it determines the \\(y\\)-intercept of the prediction line. It allows the model to better fit real-world data.\nChoosing a different set of weight values would result in a different equation, resulting in a different prediction. For example, assume instead that \\(w_0 = 25,000\\) and \\(w_1 = 300\\) resulting in the following equation:\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = 25,000 + 300 x\n\\]\nThis model would predict that the same 3,000 square-foot home has a much higher value of \\(\\$925,000 = 25,000+300*3,000\\).\nLet’s assume the $3,000 square foot home we have in mind recently sold for $800,000 reflecting it’s true value (a single instance of \\(y\\)). We could then compute the error associated with each set of model weights as the absolute value of the prediction error as follows:\n\nPrediction error when \\(w_0 = 50,\\!000\\) and \\(w_1 = 200\\): \\(\\left| 650,000 - 8000000 \\right| = 150,000\\)\nPrediction error when \\(w_0 = 25,\\!000\\) and \\(w_1 = 300\\): \\(\\left| 925,000 - 8000000 \\right| = 125,000\\)\n\nGiven these results we might reasonably conclude that the second set of model weights produced the better prediction, since it was less wrong by $25,000.\nIn machine learning this prediction error is commonly called the model’s loss, that is, how far off the prediction is from the observed truth. The mathematical function by which we compute prediction error is called the loss function. In our case, we could represent our choice of loss function as \\(\\left| \\hat{y} - y \\right|\\).\nThere are many possible choices of loss function. For example, we didn’t have to use absolute value, we could have simply taken the difference as our measurement of loss. We will discuss loss functions and introduce the most commonly used loss functions in later sections.\n\n\n3.2.2 2nd Ingredient: Training Data\nIn order for a computer to learn the best weight values for a model, we need to communicate with it in the language it understands: data. In this context, “data” refers to numerical values organized in rows and columns, like a spreadsheet or matrix. Each row is a single example, and each column holds a particular feature or label.\nFor our home value prediction example, imagine a simple dataset with two columns:\n\nOne column for the square footage of a home (the input), and\n\nOne column for the value of the home (the output).\n\nEach row contains both the square footage and the corresponding value for a particular house. Together, each pair of values forms what we call an input-output pair. A complete set of these pairs is called a dataset.\nWe can write this dataset using the following compact mathematical notation:\n\\[\n\\{(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\\}_{i=1}^n\n\\]\nThis might look intimidating at first, but it’s just a convenient way of saying:\n\n“We have \\(n\\) examples. For each example \\(i\\), we observe an input \\(x^{(i)}\\) and a corresponding output \\(y^{(i)}\\).”\n\nLet’s break down the notation a bit further:\n\nThe curly braces \\(\\{ \\}\\) mean we’re describing a set, a collection of items.\nThe superscript \\((i)\\) just means “for example number \\(i\\)”\nEach item in the set is a pair: \\((x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\\) where:\n\n\\(x^{(i)}\\) is the input (e.g., square footage) for the \\(i\\)th example\n\\(y^{(i)}\\) is the output (e.g., home value) for that same example\n\nThe subscript \\(_{i=1}^n\\) tells us there are \\(n\\) examples and we are referring to all \\(1\\) to \\(n\\) of them.\n\nIf you wrote this out as a table, it might look like this:\n\n\n\nExample (\\(i\\))\n\\(x^{(i)}\\) = Square Footage\n\\(y^{(i)}\\) = Home Value\n\n\n\n\n1\n1200\n250,000\n\n\n2\n1400\n275,000\n\n\n3\n1600\n300,000\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\\(n\\)\n(last example)\n\n\n\n\nThis is the kind of data we use to “train” a machine learning model, by showing it many examples, we give it a chance to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminology: Inputs and Outputs\n\n\n\n\n\nIn different fields and contexts, we often use different terms for the same underlying ideas. Here’s a helpful reference for the various names used for inputs and outputs in machine learning and related areas:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcept\nCommon Synonyms\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nInput\nFeature, Independent Variable, Predictor, Covariate, Regressor, \\(x\\)\nThe value(s) we feed into the model to make a prediction. Can be one variable or many.\n\n\nOutput\nLabel, Target, Dependent Variable, Response, \\(y\\)\nThe value the model is trying to predict or learn from.\n\n\nInput-Output Pair\nExample, Observation, Data Point, \\((x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\\)\nA single row of data showing both the input and the correct output.\n\n\nCollection of Examples\nDataset, Training Data, Sample\nAll the input-output pairs we give to the model to learn from.\n\n\nPredicted Output\nPrediction, Estimate, \\(\\hat{y}\\)\nThe output the model thinks is correct, based on what it learned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are actually four equivalent ways of representing a dataset, each useful in different contexts. You will be greatly aided in your study of machine learning if you can recognize and switch between all four forms with ease. Different textbooks, courses, tutorials and code libraries will use different representations so developing fluency in all of them will help you understand ideas more deeply and communicate more clearly.\n\nMathematical Set Notation:\nThis is the notation we just introduced:\n\\[\n\\{(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\\}_{i=1}^n\n\\]\n\nIt represents the dataset as a collection of \\(n\\) input-output pairs, where each \\(x^{(i)}\\) is an input and each \\(y^{(i)}\\) is the corresponding output. This form is widely used in textbooks and research papers because of its compactness and precision. It’s the language of mathematics, and it’s especially helpful when trying to understand what’s happening under the hood as computer code executes. By using this notation, we can reason more clearly about how models learn and make predictions.\n\nSpreadsheet or Table Format:\nThis is the most familiar form for most people and is often used in business and statistics. Each row represents an example; each column represents a variable or feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample (\\(i\\))\n\\(x^{(i)}\\) = Input (e.g., SqFt)\n\\(y^{(i)}\\) = Output (e.g., Price)\n\n\n\n\n1\n1200\n250,000\n\n\n2\n1400\n275,000\n\n\n3\n1600\n300,000\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\\(n\\)\n—\n—\n\n\n\nThis is also the format used in tools like Excel, Google Sheets, or data frames in Python and R.\nMathematical Matrix Notation:\nMatrix notation is a compact and powerful mathematical way to represent an entire dataset, especially when trying to understand what calculations the computer is making while executing machine learning algorithms (discussed in the next section). In matrix form:\n\n\nThe inputs are stored in a matrix called \\(X\\), with \\(n\\) rows (one for each example) and \\(d\\) columns (one for each feature or input variable).\nThe outputs are stored in a column vector called \\(y\\), with \\(n\\) rows (one for each label or true value).\n\nIf each input has just one feature (like square footage), then \\(X\\) is simply a single column of numbers (a vector). But if we have more than one input feature, for example, both square footage and number of bedrooms, then \\(X\\) becomes a matrix with multiple columns, like this:\n\\[\nX =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1^{(1)} & x_2^{(1)} \\\\\nx_1^{(2)} & x_2^{(2)} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\nx_1^{(n)} & x_2^{(n)}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nHere:\n\nEach row represents one house (one example from the dataset).\nEach column represents a feature:\n\n\\(x_1^{(i)}\\) might be the square footage of house \\(i\\)\n\\(x_2^{(i)}\\) might be the number of bedrooms in house \\(i\\)\n\n\nThis structure easily extends to more features. For example, if we also include number of bathrooms, year built, and lot size, then \\(X\\) would have 5 columns total (one for each feature).\nThe output vector \\(y\\) stays the same regardless of the number of inputs with one value per row, like the price of the home:\n\\[\ny =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ny^{(1)} \\\\\ny^{(2)} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\ny^{(n)}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nMatrix notation lets us express model computations in a compact, efficient form that computers can execute quickly.\nIt will be essential when we scale up to more than one input feature. It illustrates how a machine thinks. It’s ideal for: - Handling many examples and features - Performing vectorized calculations like dot products and gradients - Writing models in clean, code-friendly format\nMatrix notation makes your reasoning and implementation faster, clearer, and more powerful. We’ll use it throughout the course.\n\n\nCode Representation (Arrays or Tensors):\nWhen implementing models in code, we typically use arrays (Python’s NumPy package) or tensors (Python’s PyTorch package) which are data structures that store values in memory for numerical computation.\nBelow is an example with NumPy\n\n\n# NumPy\nimport numpy as np\nX = np.array([[1200], [1400], [1600]])\ny = np.array([[250000], [275000], [300000]])\nprint(\"X =\", X)\nprint(\"y = \", y)\n\nX = [[1200]\n [1400]\n [1600]]\ny =  [[250000]\n [275000]\n [300000]]\n\n\nSo what does this mean?\n\nX is a matrix of inputs (in this case, just one feature: square footage).\nEach row represents one example:\n\n1200 square feet\n\n1400 square feet\n\n1600 square feet\n\ny is a vector of outputs (the target values, like home prices).\nEach row in y matches the corresponding row in X.\n\nLet’s now connect this code back to the set and matrix representations of a dataset.\nEquivalence with Set Notation\nIn set notation this tiny dataset could be represented as three input-output pairs:\n\\[\n\\{(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\\}_{i=1}^3\n\\] More specifically:\n\n\\(x^{(1)} = 1200\\), \\(y^{(1)} = 250{,}000\\)\n\n\\(x^{(2)} = 1400\\), \\(y^{(2)} = 275{,}000\\)\n\n\\(x^{(3)} = 1600\\), \\(y^{(3)} = 300{,}000\\)\n\nEach pair \\((x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\\) is represented by a row in X and the corresponding row in y.\nEquivalence with Matrix Notation\nWe can also see how this toy dataset would be written in matrix notation as a pair of matrices, one for the inputs and one for the outputs:\n\\[\nX =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1^{(1)} \\\\\nx_1^{(2)} \\\\\nx_1^{(3)}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1200 \\\\\n1400 \\\\\n1600\n\\end{bmatrix},\n\\quad\ny =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ny^{(1)} \\\\\ny^{(2)} \\\\\ny^{(3)}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n250{,}000 \\\\\n275{,}000 \\\\\n300{,}000\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\\(X\\) is an \\(n \\times 1\\) input matrix (with one feature per example),\n\\(y\\) is an \\(n \\times 1\\) output vector (with one label per example).\n\nPyTorch Example\nLastly, below we represent the same toy dataset using PyTorch, currently the most popular deep learning library, and the one used to develop many modern large language models (LLMs).\nPyTorch uses a data structure called a tensor.\nA tensor is a generalization of familiar objects like scalars, vectors, and matrices:\n\nA scalar is a 0-dimensional tensor (e.g., 5)\nA vector is a 1-dimensional tensor (e.g., [1200, 1400, 1600])\nA matrix is a 2-dimensional tensor (e.g., a table of numbers)\nA 3D tensor is a collection or stack of matrices. You can think of it as a book of matrices, where each page is a 2D grid (matrix), and the whole book has depth (i.e., the number of pages)\nA 4D tensor is a collection of 3D tensors. You can think of it as a library of books, where:\n\nEach book is a 3D tensor (a stack of matrices),\nEach page in a book is a matrix,\nAnd each matrix contains rows and columns of numbers.\n\n\nIncreasing the tensor dimension allows us to compactly describe multiple sets of structured data and for a computer to perform parallel computations efficiently which is essential when training modern LLMs.\nIn theory, there is no limit on the number of dimensions a tensor can have.\nIn practice, we won’t need more than 4D tensors to build modern large language models (LLMs).\nFor simple models like linear regression, a 2D tensor (i.e., a matrix) is sufficient to represent the data.\nBelow we illustrate the same toy data set using a PyTorch tensor.\n\nimport torch\n\n# Input data: square footage (in one column)\nX = torch.tensor([[1200.], [1400.], [1600.]])\n\n# Output data: home prices\ny = torch.tensor([[250000.], [275000.], [300000.]])\n\nprint(\"X (inputs):\")\nprint(X)\n\nprint(\"\\ny (outputs):\")\nprint(y)\n\nX (inputs):\ntensor([[1200.],\n        [1400.],\n        [1600.]])\n\ny (outputs):\ntensor([[250000.],\n        [275000.],\n        [300000.]])\n\n\nThe dot (.) at the end of the numbers (like 1200. or 250000.) indicates that the numbers are being treated as floating point numbers (i.e., float type) rather than integers. A floating point number is a number that can represent decimal values on a computer, in contrast to an integer, which can only represent whole numbers. PyTorch models expect inputs and outputs to be floating point numbers because most model operations involve decimals.\nWe will soon use a set of training Data to help learn model parameters but before doing so we need to introduce the remaining two ingredients for machine learning: loss functions and training algorithms.\n\n\n3.2.3 3rd Ingredient: Loss Function\nA loss function is separate mathematical equation whose purpose it to quantify the error between a model’s predictions \\(\\hat{y}^{(i)}\\) and the true output values observed in the training data \\(y^{(i)}\\). When discussing mathematical model structure (i.e. simple linear regression), we briefly introduced the notion of a loss function and used the absolute value of the difference between \\(\\hat{y}^{(i)}\\) and between and \\(y^{(i)}\\) to measure prediction error (i.e. loss): \\(\\left| \\hat{y} - y \\right|\\). Note that this loss is calculated for each individual training example. That is, if we had 100 training examples (i.e. rows of data) containing the square footage and home value for 100 homes, we could compute the loss for each of these examples. The dotted lines in the plot below help you visualize the loss for each example in a set of training data.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could then find the average loss by summing up the observation level loss and dividing by the number of observations to get what is commonly called Mean Absolute Error (MAE), written as:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left| \\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)} \\right|\n\\]\nMAE is an intuitive choice for a loss function, but not the only choice. There are other equations that will measure prediction error in slightly different ways. One such equation and the most commonly used loss function when learning parameters for a simple linear regression is called Mean Squared Error (MSE), written as:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)} \\right)^2\n\\]\nRecall that \\(\\hat{y} = w_0 + w_1 x\\) hence we can plug \\(w_0 + w_1 x\\) into the equation for \\(\\hat{y}\\) to make clear that the loss function, which we denote as \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) (a stylized version of the capital Latin letter L), is a function of two variables: \\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\). This means that different values of \\(w_0\\) or \\(w_1\\) or both will yield different loss values. The goal of machine learning is to find (i.e. learn) the values of \\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\) that will make this loss function (i.e., total prediction error) as small as possible.\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}(w_0, w_1) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)})^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (w_0 + w_1 x^{(i)} - y^{(i)})^2\n\\]\nIn the next section, we will introduce a training algorithm called gradient descent. This algorithm systematically searches through different combinations of values for \\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\) to find those that minimize the loss or in other words, to learn the best-fitting line.\nTo really understand how gradient descent works, we first need to deepen our understanding of the loss function, specifically how it behaves with respect to the parameters \\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\).\nRecall that in simple linear regression, we model predictions as:\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = w_0 + w_1 x\n\\]\nWhen we think of this as a function of the input variable \\(x\\), we can plot it as a straight line on a 2D coordinate system (with \\(x\\) on the horizontal axis and \\(\\hat{y}\\) on the vertical axis) as we did earlier.\nBut now, let’s flip our perspective. In the previous section, we learned that training data consists of actual examples, pairs of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), from the real world. So once we have a training dataset, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are known. That means we no longer need to treat \\(x\\) as a variable in our model equation.\nIn this case, the prediction formula:\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = w_0 + w_1 x\n\\]\nbecomes a function where \\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\) are the unknown variables. Our goal is to adjust these weights to reduce the difference between our predicted values \\(\\hat{y}\\) and the actual outcomes \\(y\\). So during model training, we treat \\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\) as the variables to solve for, which turns our loss function into a function of two variables, \\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\):\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}(w_0, w_1) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)})^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (w_0 + w_1 x^{(i)} - y^{(i)})^2\n\\] Don’t be intimidated by the notation. Once we have a training dataset, all the \\(x^{(i)}\\) and \\(y^{(i)}\\) values are known values. The only unknowns we are solving for are \\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnpacking the notation of the MSE Loss Function\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is called the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, and it helps us measure how good or bad our model’s predictions are.\nThe big curly \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is a stylized version of the capital Latin letter L. In this context, \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) stands for “Loss” or sometimes “Loss function.”\n\n\\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\) are the parameters (or weights) of our simple linear regression model. Notice that they are playing the roles of unknown variables in this notation: \\(\\mathcal{L}(w_0, w_1)\\). This is because we don’t know what these values are or should be yet, that’s what we want the computer learn for us.\n\\(x^{(i)}\\) is the input (e.g., square footage of a house)\n\\(\\hat{y}^{(i)} = w_0 + w_1 x^{(i)}\\) is the model’s predicted output (e.g., the predicted house price).\n\\(y^{(i)}\\) is the true value (the actual house price for data point \\(i\\)).\n\\((\\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)})^2\\) is the squared error: how far off the prediction is, squared to make sure it’s always positive and to penalize big mistakes more than small ones.\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^n\\) adds up the squared errors for all \\(n\\) data points in our dataset (the Greek letter \\(\\sum\\) is called “capital sigma” and means we should “add up a bunch of terms”)\n\\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) takes the average of all those squared error terms.\n\nThis function tells us how well our model is performing overall. A smaller value means our predictions on average are close to the true values, and a larger value means on average we’re making bigger mistakes.\nOur goal is to find the values of \\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\) that make this loss function as small as possible.\n\n\n\nBecause the loss depends on both \\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\), we need three dimensions to visualize and plot this function:\n\nOne axis for \\(w_0\\)\n\nOne axis for \\(w_1\\)\n\nA vertical axis for the loss value \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) (often labeled the \\(z\\)-axis in other contexts)\n\nAs the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words, so let’s visualize what this looks like.\nIn the plot below, we graph the loss function \\(\\mathcal{L}(w_0, w_1)\\) to see it as a 3D surface, with \\(w_0\\) on the x-axis, \\(w_1\\) on the y-axis, and the height of the surface representing the mean squared error loss \\(\\mathcal{L}\\). This gives us a landscape of possible values of \\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\) to choose from.\n\n\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nAs can be seen from the plot, there are many possible choices of \\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\), each resulting in a different loss value. In the next section, we will study a foundational algorithm called gradient descent which is designed to intelligently and iteratively explore different combinations of \\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\), calculating the loss that results from each combination. The process continues until convergence occurs, that is, until the algorithm believes it has found the best choice of weights that minimize the loss. We’ll explore the details of how gradient descent works in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntuition Check\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich choice of weight values is better: point A or point B? Why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy use MSE for the loss function?\n\n\n\n\n\nMSE is the most commonly used loss function for regression problems because it has several useful properties:\n\nSmooth and differentiable: The squaring operation makes the MSE function smooth and continuous, which is important for optimization methods like gradient descent that rely on computing derivatives. (discussed in the next section)\nPenalizes large errors: By squaring the difference between prediction and truth, MSE emphasizes larger errors more than smaller ones. This is often desirable when big mistakes are especially costly.\nUnique minimum: For linear models, the MSE loss function is convex (it’s bowl shaped), meaning it has a single global minimum. This makes optimization straightforward and ensures reliable convergence during training.\n\nThese properties make MSE both practical and theoretically sound for training models to make accurate predictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 4th Ingredient: Training Algorithm\nOnce we have selected a loss function, our next task is to find the values of \\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\) that minimize it. But how do we actually do that?\nImagine you’re hiking on the inside of bowl-shaped surface of the loss function plot we explored in the previous section. Where you are standing corresponds to a specific combination of \\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\). Your goal is to get to the lowest possible point on the surface, the bottom of the bowl, where the loss is minimized and the model makes the best possible predictions.\nThe training algorithm called gradient descent helps you do exactly that in a very clever and efficient way.\nBefore taking the next step down the hill, it asks:\n\n“Which direction should I go to decrease the loss most quickly? Or equivalently, which direction is the steepest and will get me to the bottom of this bowl as fast as possible.”\n\nTo answer that question, gradient descent uses a mathematical tool called the gradient, just a fancy word for the direction of steepest ascent (what we’d call the slope in calculus). Since we want to go downhill, toward lower loss, we will actually move in the opposite (i.e. negative) direction of the gradient.\nSince we are working with a loss function of two variables, \\(\\mathcal{L}(w_0, w_1)\\), there are two different directions in play for each step we take down the hill. Hence, in this case, the gradient will be a vector with two components, one representing each direction (you can think of each component as the the “slope” in a certain direction):\n\n\\(\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_0}\\): how the loss changes when we adjust \\(w_0\\)\n\\(\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_1}\\): how the loss changes when we adjust \\(w_1\\)\n\nThese are called the partial derivatives of the function. They measure how sensitive the loss is to each parameter. They tell us the function’s rate of change as we vary one parameter at a time, holding the others constant.\nWe represent the gradient vector in the following mathematical notation:\n\\[\n\\nabla \\mathcal{L}(w_0, w_1) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_0} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_1}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the Gradient Notation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe expressions\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_0} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_1}\n\\]\nare called partial derivatives. They measure how sensitive the loss is to each parameter, essentially, how steep the slope is along each direction of the surface plot.\nHere’s what the notation means:\n\nThe partial derivative symbol \\(\\partial\\) (pronounced “partial”) means we’re measuring the rate of change with respect to just one variable, keeping the others constant.\n\\(\\mathcal{L}\\) (script L) represents the loss function, which tells us how far off our model’s predictions are from the actual outcomes.\n\\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\) are the parameters of our model.\n\nSo:\n\n\\(\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_0}\\) tells us how the loss changes if we slightly increase \\(w_0\\), holding \\(w_1\\) fixed.\n\\(\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_1}\\) tells us how the loss changes with respect to \\(w_1\\), keeping \\(w_0\\) fixed.\n\nTogether, these two values form the gradient vector of the loss function.\nThis is written compactly using the nabla symbol \\(\\nabla\\) (pronounced “nabla”, named after an ancient harp), which represents the gradient operator:\n\\[\n\\nabla \\mathcal{L}(w_0, w_1) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_0} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_1}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis vector points in the direction of steepest increase in loss. In gradient descent, we take the negative of the gradient to move in the opposite direction (steepest decent), toward the minimum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal{L}\\)\nScript L\nThe loss function\n\n\n\\(\\partial\\)\nPartial\nDerivative with respect to one variable (holds others constant)\n\n\n\\(\\nabla\\)\nNabla\nThe gradient operator—produces a vector of partial derivatives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gradient of a function always points in the direction of steepest ascent. We actually want to know the direction of the steepest descent (to get to the bottom of the bowl-shaped surface) hence will be most interested in the negative gradient (i.e. the exact opposite direction).\nIf you move in a direction other than the gradient, the loss value will either stay the same or change at a slower rate.\nThe illustration below demonstrates taking steps down the side of the bowl.",

    "text": "5.3 Key Terms\n\nVector:\nMatrix:\nDimension:\nCharacter:\nText string: A sequence of characters forming natural language (e.g., “The quick brown fox”).\nCorpus:\nTokenizer: An algorithm that splits a text string into ‘tokens.’\nTokenization: The process of using a tokenizer to split a text string into smaller units (tokens), typically words or subword fragments.\nToken: A single unit resulting from tokenization, often a word or part of a word.\nVocabulary: A fixed list of all known tokens. Each token is mapped to a unique integer (token ID).\nToken ID: A unique integer assigned to a token by a tokenizer. In Word2Vec, token IDs are not used or exposed. Instead, the token is represented directly as a character string.\nEmbedding Model: An embedding model is a model that transforms each input token—either a character string or a token ID—into a vector of real numbers. The elements of this vector capture aspects of the token’s semantic meaning, syntactic role, and relationships to other tokens in the corpus. These vector representations can then be used as input to downstream machine learning models for tasks such as classification, clustering, translation, or text generation.\n\nWord2Vec – A neural model that creates static word embeddings based on word co-occurrence. Pre-trained versions (such as the Google News model) are available off the shelf using the gensim library.\n\nEmbedding: A vector that represents a token’s learned meaning and context. GPT-2 era models typically use embedding sizes of 768 dimensions, while GPT-3 models use much larger embeddings—up to 12,288 dimensions for the largest model variants (source: Build LLMs from Scratch). Embeddings can be derived from off-the-shelf models like Word2Vec, but modern large language models (LLMs) learn these embeddings during training as part of an integrated process, rather than relying on pre-trained static embeddings. Embeddings can also be created for larger units such as sentences, paragraphs, or entire documents.\nEmbedding Matrix: A matrix in which each row contains the embedding vector for a particular token. It functions as a lookup table to retrieve the embedding for a given token (Word2Vec) or in modern LLMs a token ID. The embedding matrix is a core component of what is commonly referred to as the embedding layer in neural network models.\nEmbedding layer: A layer in a neural network that maps discrete input tokens—typically represented by token IDs—into continuous vector representations by retrieving rows from an embedding matrix. During training, this matrix is randomly initialized and then updated via backpropagation to learn useful representations. After training, the embedding layer functions as a fixed lookup table that outputs meaningful vectors for each token.\nRotary Embedding (RoPE): Positial embedding information is added at the self embedding layer.\nMixture of Experts: variant of tranformation model.\n\nRouter\n\nGenerative vs Representation Models: “Representation models are LLMs that do not generate text but are commonly used for task-specific use cases, like classification, whereas generation models are LLMs that generate text, like GPT models. Although generative models are typically the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about LLMs, there is still much use for representation models.” (Alammar and Grootendorst (2024))\n\n“In other words, the embedding layer is essentially a lookup operation that retrieves rows from the embedding layer’s weight matrix via a token ID.”\n\nTensor:\nShape: The dimensions of a tensor — specifically, the number of elements along each axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTensor Type\nRank\nExample Shape\nExample Description\n\n\n\n\nScalar\n0\n()\nA single number (e.g., 5)\n\n\nVector\n1\n(3,)\nA list of numbers (e.g., [5, 2, 7])\n\n\nMatrix\n2\n(3, 4)\nA 2D table (e.g., 3 rows × 4 columns)\n\n\n3D Tensor\n3\n(10, 3, 4)\nA stack of 10 matrices, each 3×4\n\n\nn-D Tensor\nn\n(d1, d2, ..., dn)\nAny n-dimensional array\n\n\n\n\nBackpropogation: The algorithm used to train neural networks by adjusting the model’s weights to reduce error.\nFeedforward: The process of passing input data through a neural network to produce an output. Data flows forward from the input layer through one or more hidden layers to the output layer. At each layer, neurons apply a weighted sum and an activation function (e.g., ReLU, GELU) to produce their outputs. No learning or weight updates happen during this step — it’s just computing the prediction. This is how the model computes predictions, whether during training or inference.\nLogits: “The model outputs, which are commonly referred to as logits”\nDense Vector: A vector in which most or all elements are non-zero and explicitly stored. In NLP, dense vectors (such as embeddings) represent features in a compact, continuous space and are learned during model training.\n\nInput → Feedforward → Prediction ↓ Loss Computation ↓ Backpropagation (Gradients) ↓ Optimization (Weight Update) ↓ Next iteration\nStochastic Gradient Descent:\nBatched Matrix Multiplication:\n– Transformer: Does not use an RRN.\n\nBERT: Encoder only. Good at language translation but not other tasks.\nMasked Language Modeling: Mask some of the input words and predict them.\nGenerative Models: Decoder only models.\nGPT: Generative Pretrained Transformer.\nContext Length\nGPU:\nScaled dot-product attention:\nContext vectors:\nWeight Matrix: Generic term that can refer to any trainable matrix where each element is a weight that gets updated during training.\n\nDuring training, each batch of data goes through a feedforward pass to compute a prediction, then a backpropagation pass to update the model’s weights.\nExcerpt From Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch) Sebastian Raschka This material may be protected by copyright.\n\nInput embedding: The final vector input to the model for each token, typically formed by summing token embeddings with positional (and optional segment) embeddings.\nDetokenization - The process of reconstructing a human-readable string from tokens.\nEmbeddings can be combined\n\nWord, Sentence, Document\n\nVocabulary (Bag of Words): distint list of tokens\nEncoder - The goal of an encoder is to convert input data—such as text—into a numerical representation (embedding) that captures its meaning, structure, and context. In the context of language models, encoders are designed to understand and represent the input text in a way that can be used for downstream tasks like classification, translation, or generation. Mathematically an encoder is often a recurrent neural network.\nDecoder - Goals is to generate language. Takes as inputs, embeddings, and then maps those embeddings to new embeddings, i.e. lanauge translation.\nBag-of-Words\nWord2Vec - A pre-trained model that creates word embeddings. Available off the shelf.\n\nVector Embeddings - Captures the meaning of words. Each Vector (word) embedding represents an aspect of the relationship a given word has with many other words. Each entry in a vector embedding is a number that measures something about the relationship between a word and the word the vector represents. Each vector embedding can have 1024 entries or more. The values of each entry are derived from the perameters of a neural network.\n\n“The main idea behind Word2Vec is that words that appear in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.” Excerpt From Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch) Sebastian Raschka This material may be protected by copyright.\n\nStatic embeddings. e.g. bank has the same embedding regardless if the sentence is “bank of a river” or “going to the bank”\n\nNeural network\n\nRecurrent Neural Networks - precludes parallelization. This is why the tranformer architecture was so powerful as it allows parallelization.\n\nParameters: “In the context of deep learning and LLMs like GPT, the term “parameters” refers to the trainable weights of the model. ” “These weights are essentially the internal variables of the model that are adjusted and optimized during the training process to minimize a specific loss function.”\nAutoregressive - decoders produce one new token at a time, taking the all previous tokens as input to predict the next best token.\nProjection Matrices\n\nQuery Projection\nKey Projection\nValue Projection\n\nMulti query attention\nGrouped query attention\n\nFeedforward Neural Network\nSelf-attention (encoder???). works by seeing how similar each word is to all of the words in the sentence, including it self. Calculates the simliarity between every every word in the sentence.\n\nTakes the longest and most computation. W\nAttention head\n\nAttention - First introduced in 2014. got big in 2017. Attention allows a model to focus on parts of the input that are relevant to on another. Attend to one another and amplify their signal. Attention selectively determines which words are most important in a given sentence.\nAttention: “weights”, “attends to”, “pays attention to” each input tokens embedding indepentently based on where it is in the input and output. “A way for the model to”pay attention” to different input tokens when processing each token, so it can focus more on the relevant words, even if they’re far away in the sequence.”",
