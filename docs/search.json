    "text": "Content Overview\nWelcome to Understanding AI: From Foundations to Strategy. This course seeks to help students climb the vast and rugged mountain of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) at a technical but still beginner accessible level of depth. We will not attempt to explore the entire mountain as this would be impossible in a single course. Instead, we will chart a path from the base of the mountain all the way to the peak. During the climb we will learn many of the most important AI/ML building blocks as we ascend higher. On reaching the peak (the end of the class) students will be able to see AI and ML from a new perspective and understand how modern LLMs and AI systems work (e.g. ChatGPT). The course is recommended for students who are ready to roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirty with the necessary math and code to understand how AI works from first principles. To excel in the course students should have taken a calculus, probability/stats, linear algebra, and have at least beginner level coding experience. A list of specific topics covered is shown in the figure below. Students can complete this short assessment to evaluate if they are prepared to succeed in the course.",

    "text": "Classroom Culture\n\nMission and Aims\nThe mission of Brigham Young University — founded, supported, and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life. That assistance should provide a period of intensive learning in a stimulating setting where a commitment to excellence is expected and the full realization of human potential is pursued.\nBYU seeks to develop students of faith, intellect, and character who have the skills and the desire to continue learning and to serve others throughout their lives.\nA BYU education should be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service.\nBuilding on the foundational Mission and Aims, the Marriott School of Business aspires to transform the world through Christlike leadership by developing leaders of faith, intellect, and character guided by the following 4 values:\n\nFaith in Christ - We value deep and abiding faith in Jesus Christ. Our faith gives us the capacity to envision a better future, the confidence to make that future happen, and the courage to act in the face of challenges.\nIntegrity in Action - We value integrity and hold ourselves to the highest moral and ethical standards. Acting with integrity builds trust, strengthens character, and focuses our ambitions on things of eternal consequence.\nRespect for All - We value respect for all individuals as children of God and recognize the inherent worth, divine potential, and agency of each person. A climate of respect and belonging enhances our learning, facilitates collaboration, and encourages personal growth.\nExcellence - We value excellence in learning, teaching, research, management, and leadership. An expectation of excellence magnifies our influence and motivates us to continually improve.\n\nWe evaluate our decisions and actions by the impact they will have on the academic experience, professional preparation, character development, emotional well-being, and spiritual growth of our students.\n\nPrayer in class\nWe will begin each class with prayer. Each class member is invited to be voice for the prayer at least once throughout the semester. The TAs will reach out prior to class to invite you to pray on a particular day. If you’d rather not be voice for a prayer please let me know on the first day of class so I can instruct the TAs accordingly.\n\n\nLaptop Policy\nYou may use laptops in class for note taking or other class related purposes. Laptops should not be used for activities that would be a distraction to nearby students when your screen is in their line of sight (e.g. sports, instagram, etc.)\n\n\nCold Calling\nI teach in a fairly conversational style, which includes cold calling students to ask for your input or to pose questions. If you’d rather I not cold call on you please let me know on the first day of class so that I can avoid doing so. I have deep respect for individual learning styles and will make accommodations when needed.",
