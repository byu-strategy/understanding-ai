In this course, students will learn where large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT fit into the broader landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Students will then build an LLM from the ground up using Python. The course concludes with a strategic exploration of how AI is transforming companies and society and how to harness it for good.\nThe course will begin with an essential math review but to excel in the course students should have some prior experience with differential calculus (i.e. derivatives), matrix multiplication (i.e. multiplying two or more matrices together), conditional probability, and basic Python programming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch) by Sebastian Raschka",

    "text": "Classroom Culture\n\nMission and Aims\nThe mission of Brigham Young University — founded, supported, and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life. That assistance should provide a period of intensive learning in a stimulating setting where a commitment to excellence is expected and the full realization of human potential is pursued.\nBYU seeks to develop students of faith, intellect, and character who have the skills and the desire to continue learning and to serve others throughout their lives.\nA BYU education should be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service.\nBuilding on the foundational Mission and Aims, the Marriott School of Business aspires to transform the world through Christlike leadership by developing leaders of faith, intellect, and character guided by the following 4 values:\n\nFaith in Christ - We value deep and abiding faith in Jesus Christ. Our faith gives us the capacity to envision a better future, the confidence to make that future happen, and the courage to act in the face of challenges.\nIntegrity in Action - We value integrity and hold ourselves to the highest moral and ethical standards. Acting with integrity builds trust, strengthens character, and focuses our ambitions on things of eternal consequence.\nRespect for All - We value respect for all individuals as children of God and recognize the inherent worth, divine potential, and agency of each person. A climate of respect and belonging enhances our learning, facilitates collaboration, and encourages personal growth.\nExcellence - We value excellence in learning, teaching, research, management, and leadership. An expectation of excellence magnifies our influence and motivates us to continually improve.\n\nWe evaluate our decisions and actions by the impact they will have on the academic experience, professional preparation, character development, emotional well-being, and spiritual growth of our students.\n\nPrayer in class\nWe will begin each class with prayer. Each class member is invited to be voice for the prayer at least once throughout the semester. The TAs will reach out prior to class to invite you to pray on a particular day. If you’d rather not be voice for a prayer please let me know on the first day of class so I can instruct the TAs accordingly.\n\n\nLaptop Policy\nYou may use laptops in class for note taking or other class related purposes. Laptops should not be used for activities that would be a distraction to nearby students when your screen is in their line of sight (e.g. sports, instagram, etc.)\n\n\nCold Calling\nI teach in a fairly conversational style, which includes cold calling students to ask for your input or to pose questions. If you’d rather I not cold call on you please let me know on the first day of class so that I can avoid doing so. I have deep respect for individual learning styles and will make accommodations when needed.",

    "section": "Key Terms",
    "text": "Key Terms\n\nVector:\nMatrix:\nDimension:\nCharacter:\nText string: A sequence of characters forming natural language (e.g., “The quick brown fox”).\nCorpus:\nTokenizer: An algorithm that splits a text string into ‘tokens.’\nTokenization: The process of using a tokenizer to split a text string into smaller units (tokens), typically words or subword fragments.\nToken: A single unit resulting from tokenization, often a word or part of a word.\nVocabulary: A fixed list of all known tokens. Each token is mapped to a unique integer (token ID).\nToken ID: A unique integer assigned to a token by a tokenizer. In Word2Vec, token IDs are not used or exposed. Instead, the token is represented directly as a character string.\nEmbedding Model: An embedding model is a model that transforms each input token—either a character string or a token ID—into a vector of real numbers. The elements of this vector capture aspects of the token’s semantic meaning, syntactic role, and relationships to other tokens in the corpus. These vector representations can then be used as input to downstream machine learning models for tasks such as classification, clustering, translation, or text generation.\n\nWord2Vec – A neural model that creates static word embeddings based on word co-occurrence. Pre-trained versions (such as the Google News model) are available off the shelf using the gensim library.\n\nEmbedding: A vector that represents a token’s learned meaning and context. GPT-2 era models typically use embedding sizes of 768 dimensions, while GPT-3 models use much larger embeddings—up to 12,288 dimensions for the largest model variants (source: Build LLMs from Scratch). Embeddings can be derived from off-the-shelf models like Word2Vec, but modern large language models (LLMs) learn these embeddings during training as part of an integrated process, rather than relying on pre-trained static embeddings. Embeddings can also be created for larger units such as sentences, paragraphs, or entire documents.\nEmbedding Matrix: A matrix in which each row contains the embedding vector for a particular token. It functions as a lookup table to retrieve the embedding for a given token (Word2Vec) or in modern LLMs a token ID. The embedding matrix is a core component of what is commonly referred to as the embedding layer in neural network models.\nEmbedding layer: A layer in a neural network that maps discrete input tokens—typically represented by token IDs—into continuous vector representations by retrieving rows from an embedding matrix. During training, this matrix is randomly initialized and then updated via backpropagation to learn useful representations. After training, the embedding layer functions as a fixed lookup table that outputs meaningful vectors for each token.\nRotary Embedding (RoPE): Positial embedding information is added at the self embedding layer.\nMixture of Experts: variant of tranformation model.\n\nRouter\n\nGenerative vs Representation Models: “Representation models are LLMs that do not generate text but are commonly used for task-specific use cases, like classification, whereas generation models are LLMs that generate text, like GPT models. Although generative models are typically the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about LLMs, there is still much use for representation models.” (Alammar and Grootendorst (2024))\n\n“In other words, the embedding layer is essentially a lookup operation that retrieves rows from the embedding layer’s weight matrix via a token ID.”\n\nTensor:\nShape: The dimensions of a tensor — specifically, the number of elements along each axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTensor Type\nRank\nExample Shape\nExample Description\n\n\n\n\nScalar\n0\n()\nA single number (e.g., 5)\n\n\nVector\n1\n(3,)\nA list of numbers (e.g., [5, 2, 7])\n\n\nMatrix\n2\n(3, 4)\nA 2D table (e.g., 3 rows × 4 columns)\n\n\n3D Tensor\n3\n(10, 3, 4)\nA stack of 10 matrices, each 3×4\n\n\nn-D Tensor\nn\n(d1, d2, ..., dn)\nAny n-dimensional array\n\n\n\n\nBackpropogation: The algorithm used to train neural networks by adjusting the model’s weights to reduce error.\nFeedforward: The process of passing input data through a neural network to produce an output. Data flows forward from the input layer through one or more hidden layers to the output layer. At each layer, neurons apply a weighted sum and an activation function (e.g., ReLU, GELU) to produce their outputs. No learning or weight updates happen during this step — it’s just computing the prediction. This is how the model computes predictions, whether during training or inference.\nLogits: “The model outputs, which are commonly referred to as logits”\nDense Vector: A vector in which most or all elements are non-zero and explicitly stored. In NLP, dense vectors (such as embeddings) represent features in a compact, continuous space and are learned during model training.\n\nInput → Feedforward → Prediction ↓ Loss Computation ↓ Backpropagation (Gradients) ↓ Optimization (Weight Update) ↓ Next iteration\nStochastic Gradient Descent:\nBatched Matrix Multiplication:\n– Transformer: Does not use an RRN.\n\nBERT: Encoder only. Good at language translation but not other tasks.\nMasked Language Modeling: Mask some of the input words and predict them.\nGenerative Models: Decoder only models.\nGPT: Generative Pretrained Transformer.\nContext Length\nGPU:\nScaled dot-product attention:\nContext vectors:\nWeight Matrix: Generic term that can refer to any trainable matrix where each element is a weight that gets updated during training.\n\nDuring training, each batch of data goes through a feedforward pass to compute a prediction, then a backpropagation pass to update the model’s weights.\nExcerpt From Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch) Sebastian Raschka This material may be protected by copyright.\n\nInput embedding: The final vector input to the model for each token, typically formed by summing token embeddings with positional (and optional segment) embeddings.\nDetokenization - The process of reconstructing a human-readable string from tokens.\nEmbeddings can be combined\n\nWord, Sentence, Document\n\nVocabulary (Bag of Words): distint list of tokens\nEncoder - The goal of an encoder is to convert input data—such as text—into a numerical representation (embedding) that captures its meaning, structure, and context. In the context of language models, encoders are designed to understand and represent the input text in a way that can be used for downstream tasks like classification, translation, or generation. Mathematically an encoder is often a recurrent neural network.\nDecoder - Goals is to generate language. Takes as inputs, embeddings, and then maps those embeddings to new embeddings, i.e. lanauge translation.\nBag-of-Words\nWord2Vec - A pre-trained model that creates word embeddings. Available off the shelf.\n\nVector Embeddings - Captures the meaning of words. Each Vector (word) embedding represents an aspect of the relationship a given word has with many other words. Each entry in a vector embedding is a number that measures something about the relationship between a word and the word the vector represents. Each vector embedding can have 1024 entries or more. The values of each entry are derived from the perameters of a neural network.\n\n“The main idea behind Word2Vec is that words that appear in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.” Excerpt From Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch) Sebastian Raschka This material may be protected by copyright.\n\nStatic embeddings. e.g. bank has the same embedding regardless if the sentence is “bank of a river” or “going to the bank”\n\nNeural network\n\nRecurrent Neural Networks - precludes parallelization. This is why the tranformer architecture was so powerful as it allows parallelization.\n\nParameters: “In the context of deep learning and LLMs like GPT, the term “parameters” refers to the trainable weights of the model. ” “These weights are essentially the internal variables of the model that are adjusted and optimized during the training process to minimize a specific loss function.”\nAutoregressive - decoders produce one new token at a time, taking the all previous tokens as input to predict the next best token.\nProjection Matrices\n\nQuery Projection\nKey Projection\nValue Projection\n\nMulti query attention\nGrouped query attention\n\nFeedforward Neural Network\nSelf-attention (encoder???). works by seeing how similar each word is to all of the words in the sentence, including it self. Calculates the simliarity between every every word in the sentence.\n\nTakes the longest and most computation. W\nAttention head\n\nAttention - First introduced in 2014. got big in 2017. Attention allows a model to focus on parts of the input that are relevant to on another. Attend to one another and amplify their signal. Attention selectively determines which words are most important in a given sentence.\nAttention: “weights”, “attends to”, “pays attention to” each input tokens embedding indepentently based on where it is in the input and output. “A way for the model to”pay attention” to different input tokens when processing each token, so it can focus more on the relevant words, even if they’re far away in the sequence.”",

For example, “d” and “e” may be merged into the subword “de,” which is common in many English words like “define,” “depend,” “made,” and “hidden.” The merges are determined by a frequency cutoff.”\nLayer normalization: “The main idea behind layer normalization is to adjust the activations (outputs) of a neural network layer to have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1, also known as unit variance. This adjustment speeds up the convergence to effective weights and ensures consistent, reliable training.
