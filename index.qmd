**TAs:** TBD 
**Class Time:** M/W, 3:30–4:45 PM  
**Class Location:** TNRB W308  
**LMS:** LearningSuite

## Content Overview

Welcome to Understanding AI: From Foundations to Strategy. In this course, students will learn where large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT fit into the broader landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Students will then build an LLM from the ground up using Python. The course concludes with a strategic exploration of how AI is transforming companies and society and how to harness it for good.

The course will begin with an essential math review but to excel in the course students should have some prior experience with differential calculus (i.e. derivatives), matrix multiplication (i.e. multiplying two or more matrices together), conditional probability, and basic Python programming.

## Classroom Culture

### Mission and Aims

The mission of Brigham Young University — founded, supported, and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life. That assistance should provide a period of intensive learning in a stimulating setting where a commitment to excellence is expected and the full realization of human potential is pursued.

BYU seeks to develop students of faith, intellect, and character who have the skills and the desire to continue learning and to serve others throughout their lives.

A BYU education should be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service.

Building on the foundational Mission and Aims, the Marriott School of Business aspires to transform the world through Christlike leadership by developing leaders of faith, intellect, and character guided by the following 4 values:

-   **Faith in Christ** - We value deep and abiding faith in Jesus Christ. Our faith gives us the capacity to envision a better future, the confidence to make that future happen, and the courage to act in the face of challenges.

-   **Integrity in Action** - We value integrity and hold ourselves to the highest moral and ethical standards. Acting with integrity builds trust, strengthens character, and focuses our ambitions on things of eternal consequence.

-   **Respect for All** - We value respect for all individuals as children of God and recognize the inherent worth, divine potential, and agency of each person. A climate of respect and belonging enhances our learning, facilitates collaboration, and encourages personal growth.

-   **Excellence** - We value excellence in learning, teaching, research, management, and leadership. An expectation of excellence magnifies our influence and motivates us to continually improve.

We evaluate our decisions and actions by the impact they will have on the academic experience, professional preparation, character development, emotional well-being, and spiritual growth of our students.

#### Prayer in class

We will begin each class with prayer. Each class member is invited to be voice for the prayer at least once throughout the semester. The TAs will reach out prior to class to invite you to pray on a particular day. If you'd rather not be voice for a prayer please let me know on the first day of class so I can instruct the TAs accordingly. 

#### Laptop Policy

You may use laptops in class for note taking or other class related purposes. Laptops should not be used for activities that would be a distraction to nearby students when your screen is in their line of sight (e.g. sports, instagram, etc.)

#### Cold Calling

I teach in a fairly conversational style, which includes cold calling students to ask for your input or to pose questions. If you'd rather I not cold call on you please let me know on the first day of class so that I can avoid doing so. I have deep respect for individual learning styles and will make accommodations when needed.
